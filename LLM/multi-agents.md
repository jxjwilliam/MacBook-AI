### Notes:
1. **Microsoft Magentic-One** is built on **AutoGen**, making it a more specialized implementation of the AutoGen framework.
2. **OpenAI Swarm** is still in an experimental phase, focusing on lightweight coordination and human-agent interaction.
3. **Google's multi-agent systems** are inferred based on Google's general approach to AI and cloud services, as no specific details were found in the search results.
4. **AutoGen** is highlighted for its flexibility and open-source nature, making it a popular choice for developers.
