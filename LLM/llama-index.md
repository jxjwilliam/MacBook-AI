| **Examples**              | Building chatbots with specific document retrieval, custom search engines | Conversational agents, LLM-powered apps with memory | Vector search engines, NLP processing pipelines |

## üìñ LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index)

- **Purpose**: LlamaIndex is a data framework that allows you to connect LLaMA (or other large language models) to various data sources, making it easier to perform tasks like `information retrieval`, `data querying`, and `document search`. LlamaIndex is particularly focused on helping users build AI applications that require the integration of LLMs with structured or unstructured data.
- **Features**:
  * `Data Integration`: LlamaIndex facilitates the connection of LLaMA models to external data sources like databases, document stores, or APIs, enabling the LLMs to perform specific tasks based on the data.
  * `Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)`: LlamaIndex can enhance the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external knowledge during generation, allowing for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.
  * `Customizable Pipelines`: Users can customize the way data is retrieved, processed, and presented by the LLaMA model, tailoring the output to specific use cases.

### üçì LlamaHub

### üçì LlamaLab

- A repo dedicated to building cutting-edge projects using LlamaIndex.

### üçì [LlamaCloud](https://github.com/llamacloud/llamacloud)

- LlamaCloud is a cloud-based platform for building AI applications.
- It provides a managed service for running LLaMA models, as well as a set of tools for integrating these models with external data sources.
- LlamaCloud also offers automated model deployment, scaling, and monitoring.

### üçì [LlamaParse](https://github.com/connor-jennings/llamaparse)

- A framework for parsing and generating code using LLMs.
- Supports parsing of many programming languages.

### üçì [A real world full-stack application using LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/sec-insights)

- LlamaIndex RAG, secinsights.ai, polygon.io
- .devcontainer
- backend: FastAPI, Docker, SQLAlchemy, PGVector, LLamaIndex, OpenAI
- frontend: React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- Server-Sent Events

### üçì Your choice of 3 back-ends

- `Next.js`: if you select this option, you‚Äôll have a full-stack Next.js application that you can deploy to a host like `Vercel` in just a few clicks. This uses `LlamaIndex.TS`, our TypeScript library.
- `Express`: if you want a more traditional `Node.js` application you can generate an Express backend. This also uses `LlamaIndex.TS`.
- `Python FastAPI`: if you select this option, you‚Äôll get a backend powered by the llama-index Python package, which you can deploy to a service like `Render` or `fly.io`.

### üçì Flask vs FastAPI

- Use `Flask` if you need a simple, flexible framework for a small to medium-sized application or if you‚Äôre building a traditional web application.
- Use `FastAPI` if you need to build a high-performance API, especially if you require asynchronous capabilities and automatic documentation.
