### Amazon EKS Anywhere

Amazon `EKS Anywhere` is a new deployment option for Amazon EKS that allows customers to create and operate Kubernetes clusters on customer-managed infrastructure, supported by AWS. Customers can now run Amazon `EKS Anywhere` on their own on-premises infrastructure using VMware vSphere starting today, with support for other deployment targets in the near future, including support for bare metal coming in 2022.

```bash
$ brew install aws/tap/eks-anywhere
$ type eksctl
$ export EKSA_RELEASE="0.5.0" OS="$(uname -s | tr A-Z a-z)"
$ curl "https://anywhere-assets.eks.amazonaws.com/releases/eks-a/1/artifacts/eks-a/v${EKSA_RELEASE}/${OS}/eksctl-anywhere-v${EKSA_RELEASE}-${OS}-amd64.tar.gz" \\n    --silent --location \\n    | tar xz ./eksctl-anywhere
$ sudo mv ./eksctl-anywhere /usr/local/bin/
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade eks-anywhere
$ eksctl anywhere version
```
