## 🍅 Cloudflare CDN, Bunny.next

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Use WebP or AVIF formats for smaller image sizes and faster load times.
- Enable `lazy loading` for media-heavy pages.
- Organize files with clear folder naming conventions (`/ads/`, `/screenshots/`, `/videos/`).
- Use `Next.js dynamic image routes` (`next/image` with `remotePatterns`) for automatic resizing and lazy loading.
- For videos, upload to Mux or `Cloudflare` Stream, then embed via a `<video>` component or Mux Player SDK.


### 🧭 Recommended Setup Strategy

- Host static media (ads, screenshots, product videos) in a CDN-backed storage such as Cloudflare R2 or Bunny.net Storage.
- Connect CDN URLs to your website — you can use full image/video links (e.g., https://cdn.bestitconsultants.ca/images/...).
- Optionally use a custom domain like `cdn.bestitconsultants.ca` via `CNAME` mapping for professional branding.
