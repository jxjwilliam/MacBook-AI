# Payment System Design

## Supported Payment Methods

### 1. Stripe Integration
- **PCI DSS Compliance**:
  - Elements for secure card entry
  - Never store raw payment data
  - Webhook verification for all transactions
- **Key Flows**:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD

    D --> E[Webhook Notification]
    E --> F[Fulfill Order]
  ```
